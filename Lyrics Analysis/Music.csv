Lyrics,Class
"I'll never know why I had to go
Why I had to put up such a lousy rotten show
Boy, I was tough, packing all my stuff
Saying I don't need you anymore, I've had enough
And now, look at me standing here again 'cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta have you near
As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together
Feel like a creep, never felt so cheap
Never had a notion that my love could be so deep
How could I make such a dumb mistake
Now I know I'm not entitled to another break
But please, baby, I beg you to forgive 'cause I found out that
Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma my life is here
Gotta get you near
I thought that our love was at an end but here I am again
As good as new, my love for you
And keeping it that way is my intention
As good as new and growing too
Yes, I think it's taking on a new dimension
It's as good as new, my love for you
Just like it used to be and even better
As good as new, thank God it's true
Darling, we were always meant to stay together
Yes the love I have for you feels as good as new
Darling, we were always meant to stay together",Energetic
"You're so hot, teasing me
So, you're blue, but I can't take a chance on a chick like you
That's something I couldn't do
There's that look in your eyes
I can read in your face that your feelings are driving you wild
Ah, but girl, you're only a child
Well, I can dance with you, honey, if you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby, flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?
I can see what you want
But you seem pretty young to be searching for that kind of fun
So maybe I'm not the one
Now you're so cute, I like your style
And I know what you mean when you give me a flash of that smile (smile)
But girl, you're only a child
Well, I can dance with you, honey, if you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby, flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Better slow down, girl
That's no way to go
Does your mother know?
Take it easy (take it easy)
Try to cool it, girl
Take it nice and slow
Does your mother know?
Well, I can dance with you, honey, if you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby, flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Well, I can dance with you, honey, if you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby, flirt a little maybe
Does your mother know that you're out?
Well, I can dance with you, honey, if you think it's funny
Does your mother know that you're out?
And I can chat with you, baby, flirt a little maybe",Happy
"Twinkle twinkle little star
How I wonder what you are
Like a diamond glitt'ring in the sky
Seems to me you shine your light
Down to me to say goodnight
Twinkle twinkle my old friend
Sleep is waiting round the bend
While you travel through the Milky Way
From afar
Twinkle twinkle twinkle little star

Raindrops on a window pane
Stillness of a summer rain
Silently the haze drifts through the trees
Slowly dawn is breaking through
Yet a morning without you

Curtains rustling in the breeze
I'm still trapped within my dreams
Daylight makes its way into my mind
Coming through
Yet another morning without you

Finally when darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Echoes of a voice I knew...

Half awake and half in dreams seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All to soon
Like an angel passing through my room

Long awaited darkness falls
Casting shadows on the walls
In the twilight hour I am alone
Sitting near the fireplace
Dying embers warm my face
In this peaceful solitude
All the outside world subdued
Everything comes back to me again
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

Half awake and half in dreams
Seeing long forgotten scenes
So the present runs into the past
Now and then become entwined
Playing games within my mind
Like the embers as they die
Love was one prolonged goodbye
And it all comes back to me tonight
In the gloom
Like an angel passing through my room

I close my eyes
And my twilight images go by
All too soon
Like an angel passing through my room ",Sad
"Early this morning I drove in the rain
Out to the airport to get on the plane
Hey Honololu, I'm going to Happy Hawaii
Alice has been there, she said it was fun
Swimming and surfing, enjoying the sun
Hey Honololu, we're going to Happy Hawaii
After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans oh-ooh)
ButI, but I believe love gives me a second chance
Guess I've been working a little too hard
Need a vacation, I'll send you a card
From Honololu, a greeting from Happy Hawaii
It's so exciting, why should I pretend?
In a few hours the plane will descend
Hey Honololu, we're going to Happy Hawaii
(We're going to Honolulu, we're going to Honolulu)
I can imagine the beach and the sand
Walking with someone and holding his hand
Hey Honololu, we're going to Happy Hawaii
(We're going to Honolulu)
After all I've had to go through
I'm making no plans (making no plans oh-ooh)
But I, but I believe love gives me a second chance, mmm
I've got a feeling the dream will come true
Someone is waiting and I'll forget you
Hey Honololu, we're going to Happy Hawaii
(We're going to Honolu-)",Happy
"I was a fighter always looking for trouble
And my life was so empty, there was nothing left to live for
But then it happened one night as I got into a fight
I could hear someone saying as though he was praying
Treat him well, he is your brother
You might need his help one day
We depend on one another
Love him that's the only way
On the road, on the road that we're going
We all need, we all need words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him that's the only way
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying
Treat him well, he is your brother, brother
You might need his help one day, he's your brother
We depend on one another, brother
Love him that's the only way
On the road, on the road that we're going, that we're going
We all need, we all need words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother, brother
Love him that's the only way
Treat him well, he is your brother, brother
You might need his help one day, he's your brother
We depend on one another, brother
Love him, that's the only way
Treat him well, he is your brother, brother
You might need his help one day, he's your brother
We depend on one another, brother",Happy
"I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""That's all very fine""
""Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean
And she goes
Head over heels",Relax
"So at last you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
And the price you paid
To become a woman of today
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy
Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
(Yes you can)
So you're free at last
And beginning to forget the past
Does it make you Sad
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had
But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom
Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
What's the matter with you
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
Don't you know what to do
(Yes you do)
(Ahah, yes you do yes you do)
(Ahah, yes you do yes you do)
Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
What's the matter with you
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
Don't you know what to do
Hey hey Helen (hey hey Helen)
Now you live on your own

"Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy
Honey honey, let me feel it, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, don't conceal it, a-ha, honey honey
The way that you kiss good night
The way that you hold me tight
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing
I don't wanna hurt you baby, I don't wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high
But I'm gonna stick to you boy, you'll never get rid of me
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be
Honey honey, touch me baby, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, hold me baby, a-ha, honey honey
You look like a movie star (look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are (I wonder just who you are)
And honey, to say the least, you're a doggone beast
So stay on the ground girl, you better not get too high
There's no other place in this world where I rather would be
Honey honey, how you thrill me, a-ha, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, a-ha, honey honey
I'd heard about you before (I'd heard about you before)
I wanted to know some more (I wanted to know you some more)
And now I know what they mean, you're a love machine Oh, you make me dizzy",Happy
"I am just a girl
One among the others
Nothing much to say
Plain and simple girl
Not the special type in any way
Just one look and you will surely see
That the true Miss Nobody is me
It's an evil world
That has only made me a girl
I am just a girl
Not the kind of woman
Men would like to meet
Just another girl
No one ever looks at in the street
But today I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered 'I love you'
Darling I could see I was meant to be your girl
It's a funny feeling when you get to love someone
And thinking that he'll never look your way
But then he say he loves you
And life has just begun
It's so much more than any words can say
I am just a girl
Not the kind of woman
Men would like to meet
Just another girl
No one ever looks at in the street
But today I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered 'I love you'
Darling I could see I was meant to be your girl
But today I can't believe it's true
When you smiled and whispered 'I love you'
Darling I could see I was meant to be your girl",Sad
"i am the city, you let me be
i am the city
Coming through a cloud you're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size
And you feel a strange attraction
The air is vibrant and electrified
Welcome to me here I am, my arms are open wide
Somewhere in the middle of the never ending noise
There is a constant steady rhythm of a heart that beats
And a million voices blend into a single voice
And you can hear it in the glamor of the crowded streets
People come and take their chances
Sometimes you win sometimes you lose a lot
Come make your own contribution to this melting pot
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil, the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me
Yes I am the city, you let me be
People feed me with their lives I have a hungry soul
And they all worship me and pay their homage day and night
Every day I knew a lot of tired shopping feet
But come the night they will be dancing in the neon light
Dazzled by the crazy magic
They're grabbing pieces of the fatted calf
And in the wind if you listen hard you'll hear me laugh
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
The skyline is me and the energy
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil, the cars and the people
The parks and the squares that you see
All the sounds that you hear
And the air that you're breathing is me
Yes I am the city, you let me be
I am the city
You let me be
I am the city
The famous hotels and the cocktail bars
And the funny smells
And the turmoil the cars and the people
The air that you're breathing is me
Coming through a cloud
You're looking at me from above
And I'm a revelation spreading out before your eyes
I'm the street you walk
The language you talk
I am the city
Yes I am the city, you let me be
And you find me beautiful and irresistible
A kind of creature that forever seems to grow in size

"I Have a Dream, a song to sing
To help me cope, with anything
If you see the wonder, of a fairy tale
You can take the future, even if you fail
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I Have a Dream
I Have a Dream, a fantasy
To help me through, reality
And my destination, makes it worth the while
Pushin' through the darkness, still another mile
I believe in angels
Something good in everything I see
I believe in angels
When I know the time is right for me
I'll cross the stream, I Have a Dream

"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day
Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way
Into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak",Relax
"You're so free, "" that's what everybody's telling me
Yet I feel I'm like an outward-bound, pushed around, refugee
Something's wrong, got a feeling that I don't belong
As if I have come from outer space, out of place, like King Kong
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, round and round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown
Like a doll, like a puppet with no will at all
And somebody taught me how to talk, how to walk, how to fall
Can't complain, I've got no one but myself to blame
Something's happening, I can't control, lost my hold, is it safe?
I'm a marionette, just a marionette, pull the string
I'm a marionette, everybody's pet, just as long as I sing
I'm a marionette, see my pirouette, round and round
I'm a marionette, I'm a marionette, just a silly old clown
""Look this way, just a little smile, "" is what they say
""You look better on the photograph if you laugh, that's okay""

"I still have faith in you
I see it now
Through all these years that faith lives on
Somehow
There was a union
Of heart and mind
The likes of which are rare
And, oh, so hard to find
Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
I still have faith in you
And I will say
I never really thought I'd feel this way
But I remind myself
Of who we are
How inconceivable it is to reach this far
Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story and it survived
And we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage is everything
I still have faith in you
It stands above
The crazy things we did
It all comes down to love
Do I have it in me?
I believe it is in there
For I know I hear a bittersweet song
In the memories we share
Do I have it in me?
We do have it in us
New spirit has arrived
The joy and the sorrow
We have a story and it survived
And we know that we need one another
Like fighters in a ring
We're in this together
Passion and courage is everything
and we still have it in us
We've only just begun

"I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think I was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

"I've always hated my room, it's so gloomy and dreary
Always the dark, for the windows just face the back yard
So I can't understand how it's happened, how everything's changing
This old dirty ceiling seems a little whiter
When you walked into the room it all got so much brighter
You must have a lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
And I can feel your love anywhere (shining)
Maybe even when you're not there (shining)
The lovelight
Everything around you is lovelight
You're shining like a star in the night (shining)
I won't let you out of my sight (shining)
I don't want to lose you, I don't want to lose your lovelight
How I remember the first time we went to movie
We had decided to meet on the corner downtown

When you came into my life it all got so much brighter

"I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
and I can hear a bell ring
(One more look) and I forget everything, whoa
Mamma mia, here I go again
My, my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My, my, I could never let you go
I've been Angry and Sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong
and I can hear a bell ring

Mamma mia, here I go again
My, my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
Bye-bye, leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
Bye-bye doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My, my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My, my, just how much I've missed you?

"Did you see that man in the limousine
With the pretty doll, he is fifty and the girl's only seventeen
But she doesn't care, and she never will
If he's ninety-five she don't give a damn
Just as long as he pays the bill
Did you see that man with a fat cigar
He just left his lovers with a belly full of lobster and caviar
He can choose the wine from a vintage year
He will drink champagne in his limousine
Where the rest of the street can peer
'Cause he's the Man In The Middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross
'Cause he's the Man In The Middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be
Man In The Middle, the middle, the middle
In the middle (in the middle, in the middle...)
But you see that man made a big mistake
Even though he's got all his servants and a mansion beside a lake
And the money too, all that he can spend
He can buy the most, nearly anything
But he can't buy an honest friend
'Cause he's the Man In The Middle, never second fiddle
Just like a spider in a cobweb
Hard as a hammer, not the kind of boss you double-cross
'Cause he's the Man In The Middle, knows the way to diddle
He's never bothered by his conscience
Deals with the Devil, 'cause he wants to be

I am invincible, how could this go wrong?

In the mirror of your eyes, my love, my life
I can see it all so clearly
All I love so dearly
Images passing by
Like reflections of your mind, my love, my life
Are the words I try to find, my love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
With all my heart, God bless you
You will be my love and my life
You're my one and only
I held you close to me
Felt your heartbeat and I thought I am free
Oh, yes and as one are we
In the now and beyond
Nothing and no one can break this bond

All I love so dearly

"No smiles, not a single word at the breakfast table
Though I would have liked to begin
So much that I want to say, but I feel unable
You leave and slam the door
Like you've done many times before
And I cry and I feel so helpless
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end
Outside I can see the sun through the open window
Inside everything feels so cold
What's wrong, what is happening, where did all our love go?
Sometimes when I just can't cope
I cling to a desperate Energetic
And I cry and I feel like dying
One man, one woman
Two friends and two true lovers
Somehow we'll help each other through the hard times
One man, one woman
One life to live together
One chance to take that never comes back again
You and me, to the end
Daydreams of a better life, but I have to wake up
The sound of the key in the door
You smile and I realize that we need a shake-up
Our love is a precious thing
Worth the pain and the suffering
And it's never too late for changing
One man, one woman

Saddle your horse, my dear
And ride off into the sunset
You'd better go for there is no place for you here

You stand before me, oh, oh, oh, oh
You think our life is a movie
My world is real, I live and feel and I can do without you
Put on your white sombrero
Your red bandana too
Think of this day as a showdown
Goodbye, my friend, this is the end for me and you
Now be a bold vaquero
Don't show your feelings, ah, ah, ah, ah
I'll cry while you're disappearing
Into the night all dressed in white unchained and free without me
Put on your white sombrero

Go find a sweet se¤orita
Somebody meek who'll never speak harshly to you
You're such a caballero
Proud, never bending, ah, ah, ah, ah

And it means something special to me
Look at the way that she smiles when she sees me
How lucky can one fellow be

She's just my kind of girl, without her I'm blue
And if she ever leaves me what could I do, what could I do

Then she holds me and squeezes my hand
We'll go on walking for hours and talking
About all the things that we plan

He stands
Towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me
I must take him seriously
Droning on the usual way
He's such a clever guy
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry
He's dressed
In the striped pyjamas that I bought
Trousers too short
Gives me
On his small philosophy
Carries on the way he does
And me I get so tired
And I wonder
Should I laugh or cry

High and mighty, his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes
To grow in size
All I see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in the warm
And save cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should I laugh or cry

Strange how
Dangerously indifferent I have grown
Cold as a stone
No more
Pain as there was pain before

I feel my throat go dry

Looking down at people passing by
Sitting here no-one can harm me

Until you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind, won't you please

Like I was a monkey at the zoo
But I will stay here, among my coconuts
So you will know dear, you're everything I've got
Now won't you tell me, Jeanie Jeanie on my mind
Winds blow, stars glow, I see a light in a window
Dark trees, soft breeze, carry my message to her please
See me sitting in the palm tree
Feeling Angry at the silly crowd
No-one else but you can calm me

I need to show you, I've got my feelings too

Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park

Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free, ah-ah

I just know it's time to go

From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give
Time to breathe and time to live
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark

Somehow something turns me on
Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone
I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere, ah-ah

I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning

It's a dream, it's out of reach

Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show
And all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tschaikovsky had the news, he said
Let there be sound, and there was sound
Let there be light, and there was light
Let there be drums, there was drums
Let there be guitar, there was guitar
Oh, let there be rock!
And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
All across the land every rockin' band
Was blowin' up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The business man got rich
And in every bar there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There was fifteen million fingers
Learnin' how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say
Let there be light, sound, drums, guitar
Oh, let there be rock!

There was a 42 decibel rockin' band

It was so dark, that I could hardly see,
It smelled so sweet, you know who and Joanie,
So many butterflies, one could not see...
We all could feel desire, took off in flight,
It was hotter than fire, then came the light.
I smell the heat, the dancing ponies,
Unwrapped his wings, to dry off Joanie,
The pony he grew in size, the thunder and rain,
And finally realized, what was, what it does, and what it come to say.
Love to kiss the cheek of mother Nature, nobody here can deni such things,
Make the ladies you love come honey, no butterfly should be denied its wings...

He was a one time fantasy, I got the bare bones riding to the Holy Land,
Bare backed, riding like a running man, nightmares,
And he can't hold the candle to my dreams!
We rode the night, and took to wing, it was so all right, it was everything,
We flew into burning skies, the thunder and rain, and finally realized,
What it is, what it does, and what it come to say!
No, no, no, no, took off in flight,
No, no, no, no, then came the light.
Flashback, somethings coming over me, no sweat one time fanatsy.
Bare bones all in the wind it seems, hell, who's the chick,
That rides into my dreams?
No Libury,
No stablize,
No one try to please,
Nobody's eyes.
We'll never see us again, tell me when it passed,
Let it all begin, but all of that time, somebody shot an arrow...

Breaking me cause your cold sometimes...
Being seduced by your own pleasures,
Being king on your own time...

You gave everything this golden glow

Everything that we went through
Now, without you, what on earth am I to do?
When I called the mathematicians and I ask them to explain
They said love is only equal to the pain
And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song

Now when it comes to envy y'all is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the rhyme routine
Another dimension, new galaxy
Intergalactic, planetary
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic
We're from the Family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and Relax your socks
The rhymes are spread just like a pox
'Cause the music is loud like an electric shock
I am known to do the wop
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D gets biz on the crops
Beastie Boys known to let the beat
Mmm, drop!
Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If my rap's soup, my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm a lumberjack DJ Ad-Rock
If you try to knock me you'll get mocked
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees'll start shakin' and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck of Mr. Spock
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, intergalactic

Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Go by the name of the king Ad-Rock
Super educated, I'm smarter than Spock
You ever tell me, you will agree
Ain't no brother like the KRD
You know what I mean?
Tell you, put the echo?
Tell you",Energetic
"Kick it!
You wake up late for school, man you don't want to go
You ask you mom, please? but she still says, no
You missed two classes, and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk
You gotta fight for your right to party
Your pops caught you smoking, and he says, ""No way!""
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (bust it!)
You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight
Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, what's that noise?
Aw, mom you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys
You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight for your right to party
Party",Relax
"Ah yeah
I looked out the window seen his bald head
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair
Launched that shot and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
I loaded up the slingshot, let one fly
He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check, correct, with my egg-gun
The egg, a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke
The trigger, I pulled his face, the yolk
Reached in his pocket, took all his cash
Left my man standing with the egg mustache
Suckers, they come a dime a dozen

I'm on like Dr. John, yeah, Mr. Zu Zu
I'm a newlywed, not a divorcee (yeah)
And everything I do is funky like Lee Dorsey",Energetic
"Well, me in the corner with a good looking daughter
I dropped my drawers, said welcome back Kotter
We was cutting up the rug, she started cutting up the carpet
In my apartment, I begged her, please stop it
The gift of gab is the gift that I have
And that girl ain't nothing but a crab
Educated no, stupid yep
And when I say stupid, I mean stupid fresh
I'm not James at fifteen or Chachi in charge
I'm Adam and I'm adamant about living large
With the white sassoons and the looks that kill
Makin' love in the back of my Coupe De Ville
I met a little cutie she was all hopped up on zootie
I liked the little cutie but I kicked her in the bootie
'Cause I don't kinda go for that messin' around
You be listening to my records' a number one sound
Just step to the rhythm, step, step to the ride
I've got an open mind so why don't you all get inside?
Tune in, turn on to my tune that's live
Ladies flock like bees to a hive
Hey ladies, get funky",Relax
"""Now I got the gun, you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me""
I said, I'll ride with you if can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this, I did it like that
I did it with a wiffleball bat
So I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Adrock that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne""
We rode for six hours then we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said ""Y-y-yo, you know this kid?""
I said, I didn't, but I know he did
The kid said ""Get ready 'cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D and I'm about to get money""
Pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky
He yelled ""Stick 'em up"" and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
""I'm Mike D and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""
MCA was with it and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano player's out, the music stopped
His boy had beef and he got dropped
Mike D grabbed the money, MCA Snatched the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold",Energetic
"Armed insurrection, popular election
Get paid every year like tax collection
Hear my perfection, rotary connection
Taking MCs down by lethal rap injection
I'm like an ornithologist when I get pissed
You must have drank a fizzy-lifting drink and you got lifted
And sifted, I'm just whiffed
And when I catch MCs, it's time for wing-clipping
I fly like a hawk, or better yet an eagle
A seagull, I sniff suckers out like a beagle
My ego is off and running and gone
'Cause I'm about the best and if you diss than that's wrong
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight",Happy
"Pass me the scalpel, I'll make an incision
I'll cut off the part of your brain that does the bitching
Put it in formaldehyde and put it in the shelf
And you can show it to your friends and say, ""That's my old self""
Can't do me nothing, can't tell me nada
Don't quote me now because I'm doing the lambada
The forbidden dance, here's my chance
To make romance in my B-boy stance
Parlay romancing into the financing
Opened up a restaurant with Ted Danson
The roaches check in, but they never check out
I set the record straight, no doubt
We got a party on the left, a party on the right
We gonna party for the motherfucking right to fight",Happy
"Well this girl came up to me, she says she's new in town
But the crew been said they seen her around
I thought they were right but I didn't want to know
The girlie was Def and she wanted to go
I think her name is Lucy but they all call Loose
I think I thought I seen her on eighth and forty-deuce
The next think she said, my place or yours?
Let's kick some bass behind closed doors!
We got into the cab, the cab driver said
He recognized my girlie from the back of her head
He said a little something about tip to base
So I made him stop the cab to get out of the place
I shouldn't have looked back man I'll always regret it
Something's going on and I'll probably never get it
She was crying like a baby, stupid dumb
It's just too bad that girl's a bum
She's crafty, she's gets around
She's crafty, she's always down
She's crafty, she's got a gripe
She's crafty, and she's just my type
She's crafty",Relax
"I spent my last dollar to buy a Sabrett
When I seen this girl I could never forget
Now I like nothing better than a pretty girl smile
And I haven't seen a smile that pretty in a while
The girl came up to me she said she loved the show
Asked her to come home and she couldn't say, no
We got the crib, there's Adam and D.
We didn't say a word, they just stared at me
I said, I don't know her just met her tonight
And Adrock started hiding everything in sight
D. pulled me over said, hide your gold,
The girl is crafty like ice is cold!
The girl is crafty, she knows all the moves
I started playing records, she knew all the grooves
He thought she was a thief and D. was right
But I just figured she'd spend the night
When I woke up later in the afternoon
She had taken all the things from inside his room
I found myself naked in the middle of the floor
She had taken the bed and the chest of drawers
The mirror, the TV, the new guitar cord
My remote control and my old skateboard
She robbed us blind, she took all we owned
And the boys blamed me for bringing her home",Sad
"Body movin', body movin'
A1 sound, and the sound's so soothing

Now, let me get some action from the back section
We need body rockin' not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
And let your spine unwind, just take a risk
I wanna' do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people is that so wrong
The ship is docking, interlockin'

The sound of the music makin' you insane

I said, ooh my my and thank you, ma'am
And when I grab the mic you scream, 'ooh, goddamn'

Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim
And Adrock, light up the place

And if you ask me turn up the bass
And if you play defender

That your love was all mine

"Far between sundown's finish
An' midnights broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts
Struck shadows in the sound
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' every underdog soldier in the night
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
Even though a cloud's white curtain
In a far-off corner flashed
An' the hypnotic splattered mist Was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing",Relax

Never with a herd
Prettiest mare I've ever seen
You'll have to take my word
I'm going to catch that horse if I can
And when I do I'll give her my brand
Well I was up on Stony Ridge
After this chestnut mare, been chasing her for weeks
Oh I'd catch a glimpse of her every once in a while
Taking her meal, bathing, fine lady
This one day I happen to be real close to her
And I saw her standing over there
So I snuck up on her nice and easy
Got my rope out
And I flung it in the air!

Higher than I've ever been before
She's running along just fine
'Til she stops and something spooked her
It's a sidewinder, all coiled and ready to strike
She doesn't know what to do for a second
But then, she jumps off the edge, me holding on
Above the hills, higher than eagles were gliding
Suspended in the sky

And we're falling down right through it
We hit, we splashed it dry
That's when I lost my hold
And she got away
But I'm gonna try and get her again some day
I'm going to catch that horse if I can

A warm familiar place to be swept into

Both a beginning and an end
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize when he catches his reflection on accident
On the back of a motorbike with your arms outstretched trying to take flight, leaving everything behind

With your hands on my shoulders, a meaningless movement, a movie script ending.

In the sappiest songs (yes, yes)
I'll put them to bed, but they won't sleep, they're just shuffling the sheets,
They toss and turn (you can't begin to get it back)

Against the silver sheen of a moon like painted glass
Under stars out on a pier; a celestial sphere
We were weightless as the waves that disappeared
Northern lights filled our skies
Empty nights synchronized

Well I'm sorry girl
Here's my confession
I suppose a rock's out of the question?

And look for a job in the town

"These are the words of a frontier lad
Who lost his love when he turned bad

Please don't mention the stagecoach and the shot from a careless gun
You can tell her I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding day
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Until my dying day
Take a message to Mary but don't tell her all you know
My heart's achin' for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so
Just tell her I went to Timbuktu, tell her I'm searchin' for gold
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold

Please report to the chapel across the street at once""

As we sat a-courtin'
My love fell off to sleep
I had a bottle of Burgundy wine

I drew a saber through her
It was a bloody knife
I threw her in the river

That money would set me free
If I would murder that dear little girl

And a strange, strange pond

In the thick of a forest without a road

Then I think it would've showed
That's why it seems like a dream
Got me hypnotized

To ask if those stories are right

You get when you're hypnotized

"I was walking down the street the other day
A sight came before my eyes
It was a little hippie boy
I must have been twice his size
His appearance typefied his strange breed
Gaudy clothes, long stringy hair hanging down
I'd seen perhaps a thousand
In my early trips to town
As he walked on beside me on down the block
I noticed no unpleasing smell
He might have been on the weed or even LSD
But if he was I couldn't tell
So we walked together that way through this neighborhood
Finally he turned around to me and he
He said ""friend you know we're a million miles apart
But you know something?
We can enjoy the sunshine and the weather
So why don't we put our differences aside
And just talk to each other?",Happy

But when he came back he sort of lost his way walking through the crowd
One of them things you ask yourself,
How the Lord allowed
But when he was found he was like he is now,
Dreaming sweet and still
And in his little hand was a crumpled dollar bill
Now you can take that dollar
Get four cents on it, compound it quarterly at any downtown bank
So they can back some hot new tank or atom bomb
Well, what I'm going to tell you now, you can stay or you can leave
You kind of listened to my story so far but just one more thing
It's the same for any hippie, bum or hillbilly out on the street
Just remember this little boy and never carry more than you can eat
Now could you help us sing this song, please
There will be peace in the valley for him now we pray
I will think of the little hippie boy that way",Happy

That I made her the image of me.
I met her in a little country town

That's where I found myself
With a bottle of wine
And some pills off the shelf

All the shades were pulled and drawn (way down tight)
From within, the dim light cast two silhouettes on the shade
Oh, what a lovely couple they made
Put his arms around your waist (held you tight)
Kisses I could almost taste (in the night)
Wondered why I'm not the guy whose silhouette's on the shade
I couldn't hide the tears in my eyes

Lost control and rang your bell (I was sore)
Let me in or else I'll beat (down your door)
When two strangers who have been two silhouettes on the shade
Said to my shock, ""You're on the wrong block""
Rushed out to your house with wings (on my feet)
Loved you like I'd never loved (you my sweet)
Vowed that you and I would be two silhouettes on the shade
All of our days, two silhouettes on the shade",Sad

Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
If your cup is full, may it be again
Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men
There is a road, no simple highway
Between the dawn and the dark of night
And if you go, no one may follow
That path is for your steps alone
Ripple in still water

Running from her head

Portrayal of the trauma and degeneration
The sorrows we suffered and never were free

Weary inside, now our heart's lost forever

To find the right side of reason
To kill the three lies for one

I can see through your eyes
All this talk made no contact
No matter how hard we tried
Three-one-G
Three-one-G
Three-one-G
I can still hear the footsteps
I can see only walls
I slid into your man-traps
With no hearing at all
I just see contradiction
Had to give up the fight
Just to live in the past tense
To make believe you were right

"I walked through the city limits

(Saw the place where she had a room to stay) A wire fence where the children play
(Saw the bed where the body lay) And I was looking for a friend of mine
(And I had no time to waste) Yeah, looking for some friends of mine
The cars screeched, hear the sound on dust
(Heard a noise, just a car outside) Metallic blue turned red with rust
(Pulled in close by the building's side) In a group, all forgotten youth

"Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same (Getting darker now, faces look the same)
And I walked round and round, nail me to a train (No stomach, torn apart, had to think again)
Trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out (Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out)
Four, twelve windows, ten in a row
(Behind a wall, well I looked down low) The lights shined like a neon show
(Inserted deep, felt a warmer glow) No place to stop, no place to go

A journey that leads to the sun,
Soulless and bent on destruction,
A struggle between right and wrong.
You take my place in the showdown,
I'll observe witha pitiful eye,
I'll humbly ask for forgiveness,
A request well beyond you and i.
Heart and soul, one will burn.
Heart and soul, one will burn.
An abyss that laughs at creation,
A circus complete with all fools,
Foundations that lasted the ages,
Then ripped apart at their roots.
Beyond all this goos is the terror,
The grip of a mercenary hand,
When savagery turns all good reason,
There's no turning back, no last stand.
Heart and soul, one will burn.
Heart and soul, one will burn.
Existence well what does it matter?
I exist on the best terms i can.

The present is well out of hand.

A strangeness so hard to reflect.
A moment so moving, goes straight to your heart,

Complete but rejected too soon.
Looking ahead in the grip of each fear,
Recalls the life that we knew.
The shadow that stood by the side of the road,
Always reminds me of you.

All the conflict inside, all the problems beside,
As the questions arise, and the answers don't fit,

Travel first and lean towards this time.
Oh, I'll break them down, no mercy shown

Watching her, these things she said
The times she cried
Too frail to wake this time.

"These are the times that try men's souls
In the course of our nation's history
The people of Boston have rallied bravely
Whenever the rights of men have been threatened
Today, a new crisis has arisen
The Metropolitan Transit Authority
Better known as the MTA
Is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population
In the form of a subway fare increase
Citizens, hear me out!
This could happen to you!
Well let me tell you of the story
Of a man named Charlie
On a tragic and fateful day
He put ten cents in his pocket
Kissed his wife and family
Went to ride on the MTA",Energetic
"Well did he ever return?
No he never returned
And his fate is still unlearned (what a pity)
He may ride forever
'Neath the streets of Boston
He's the man, who never returned
Charlie handed in his dime
At the Kendall Square station
And he changed for Jamaica Plain
When he got there the conductor told him one more nickel
Charlie couldn't get off of that train!
But did he ever return?
No he never returned
And his fate is still unlearned (poor old Charlie)
He may ride forever
'Neath the streets of Boston
He's the man, who never returned",Energetic
"But did he ever return?
No he never returned
And his fate is still unlearned (he may ride forever)
He may ride forever
'Neath the streets of Boston

Pick it, Davey
... (kinda hurts my fingers)
Now you citizens of Boston
Don't you think its a scandal
How the people have to pay and pay?
Fight the fare increase!
Vote for George O'Brien
Get poor Charlie off the MTA
Or else he'll never return
No, he'll never return
And his fate is still unlearned (just like Paul Revere)
He may ride forever
'Neath the streets of Boston
He's the man, who never returned
He's the man, who never returned
He's the man, who never returned

I took it to be a mirage at first, it'll fool a thirsty man
Then I saw a note stuck in a bakin' powder can
This pump is old, the note began, but she works so give'er a try

You've got to give of yourself 'fore you're worthy to receive
Drink all the water you can hold, wash your face, cool your feet
Leave the bottle full for others, thank you kindly, desert Pete
Yeah, you'll have to prime the pump, work that handle like there's a fire

You've got to give until you getI'm the one who ought to know
So I poured in the jar and I started pumpin' and I heard a beautiful sound

"He rode easy in the saddle. He was tall and lean, and at first you'd a-thought nothing but a streak of mean could make a man look so down right strong, but one look in his eyes and you knowed you was wrong. He was a mountain of a man, and I want you to know. He could preach hot hell or freezin' snow. He carried a Bible in a canvas sack and folks just called him The Reverend Mr. Black. He was poor as a beggar, but he rode like a king. Sometimes in the evening, I'd hear him sing:
I gotta walk that lonesome valley. I got to walk it by myself. Oh nobody else can walk it for me. I got to walk it by myself.
You got to walk that lonesome valley. You got to walk it by yourself. Oh nobody else can walk it for you. You got to walk it by yourself.
If ever I could have thought this man in black was soft and had any yellow up his back, I gave that notion up the day a lumberjack came in and it wasn't to pray. Yeah, he kicked open the meeting house door and he cussed everybody up and down the floor! Then, when things got quiet in the place, he walked up and cusses in the preacher's face! He hit that Reverend like a kick of a mule and to my way of thinkin' it took a real fool to turn the other face to that lumber jack, but that's what he did, The Reverend Mr. Black. He stood like a rock, a man among men and he let that lumberjack hit him again, and then with a voice as quiet as could be, he cut him down like a big oak tree when he said:
I gotta walk that lonesome valley. I got to walk it by myself. Oh nobody else can walk it for me. I got to walk it by myself.
It's been many years since we had to part and I guess I learned his ways by heart. I can still hear his sermon's ring, down in the valley where he used to sing. I followed him, yes, sir, and I don't regret it and I hope I will always be a credit to his memory 'cause I want you to understand. The Reverend Mr. Black was my old man!

Said I, ""My friend, I'd like to go to Morrow and return no later than tomorrow for I haven't time to burn.""
Said he to me, ""Now let me see if I have heard you right. You'd like to go to Morrow and return tomorrow night.
You should have gone to Morrow yesterday and back today for the train that goes to Morrow is a mile upon its way.

Inside my telescope I see
A pair of eyes look back at me
He walks and talks and looks like me
Sits around inside his house
From room to room he moves about
Fills his life with pointless things

Do do do do do
Do do do do do
Safe to say that
I don't think you understand
There's nowhere left to turn
Walls keep breaking
Time is like a leaf in the wind
Either it's time well spent
Or time I've wasted
Don't waste it
Afraid of what the truth might bring
He locks his doors and never leaves
Desperately searching for signs
To terrify, to find a thing

Frantically searching his dreams
He wonders what it's all about

Swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms
Mercy, Mercy, looking for Mercy Street...
Looking for Mercy, Mercy...

"Just yesterday mornin', they let me know you were gone
Suzanne, the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
I just can't remember who to send it to
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Won't you look down upon me, Jesus?
You've got to help me make a stand
You've just got to see me through another day
My body's aching and my time is at hand
And I won't make it any other way
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you again
Been walking my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows, when the cold wind blows
It'll turn your head around
Well, there's hours of time on the telephone line
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
Oh, I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend
But I always thought that I'd see you, baby
One more time again, now
Thought I'd see you one more time again
There's just a few things coming my way this time around, now
Thought I'd see you, thought I'd see you, fire and rain, now",Sad
"I remember when I was a little girl, our house caught on fire
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up
In his arms and raced through the
Burning building out on the pavement
And I stood there shivering in my pajamas
And watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over I said to myself
Is that all there is to a fire?
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
And when I was twelve years old
My daddy took me to the circus, the greatest show on Earth
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
And as I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what, but when it was over I said to myself
Is that all there is to the circus?
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
And then I fell in love
With the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take long walks by the river or
Just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love
Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die, but I didn't
And when I didn't I said to myself
Is that all there is to love?
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep
I know what you must be saying to yourselves
If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all?
Oh, no, not me, I'm not ready for that final disappointment
Because I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you
That when that final moment comes and I'm
Breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is",Sad
"Rows and floes of angel hair
And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere
I've looked at clouds that way
But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know
Don't give yourself away
I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take, and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all
Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
Well something's lost, but something's gained
In living every day
I've looked at life from both sides now
From win and lose and still somehow

Look from the outside
To the world I left behind

You're awake
If I were sleeping
What's at stake
A day without me
Whatever the feelings
I keep feeling
What are the feelings
You left behind
Today's a day without me

I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers
In a tomb, in bloom
Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
You don't understand who they thought
I was supposed to be
Look at me now a man
Who won't let himself be
Down in a hole, feelin' so small
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
I'd like to fly, but my wings have been so denied
Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place
I've eaten the sun so my tongue
Has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath
Down in a hole, feelin' so small
Down in a hole, losin' my soul
I'd like to fly but my wings have been so denied
Bury me softly in this womb

"Screaming at the window
Watch me die another day
Hopeless situation endless price I have to pay
Sanity, now it's beyond me, there's no choice
Diary of a madman
Walk the line again today
Entries of confusion
Dear diary, I'm here to stay
Manic depression befriends me
Hear his voice
Sanity now it's beyond me
There's no choice
A sickened mind and spirit
The mirror tells me lies
Could I mistake myself for someone
Who lives behind my eyes?
Will he escape my soul?
Or will he live in me?
Is he tryin' to get out or tryin' to enter me?
Voices in the darkness
Scream away my mental health
Can I ask a question
To help me save me from myself?

Slowly slips through your hands
When you feel like you just slept
Through all the best years of your life
When you can't find your way
When each day ends the same
When you've lost the fight inside of you
Is there anything worth holding on to?

When weakness is stronger
I'm a prisoner in my own skin
I'm not good on my own
I need to be careful
Someone to help these days begin
There are dreams I've let die
That I just pushed aside
I need to find out how to turn this dark back into light
When the warmth disappears
When it's been one of those years
When you're running from the truth
Because, well, you're escared of what you might find
When your heart's beyond repair
When you wake and no one's there
When your home consists of only you
Is there anything worth holding on to?
Maybe tomorrow my heart will reawaken
And I can find what I've been searching for
But today I'm tired and I'm running out of strength
All I know is I can't live like this anymore (this anymore)
When you're so far from home
When you've lost all signs of hope
When you're searching for salvation

A loaded gun won't set you free

We'll share a drink and step outside

We'll give you everything and more

Tried to swim, stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18

Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream

And in a pipe she flies to the motherland
Sells love to another man

Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

About sound and vision?

That's the colour of my room

Pale blinds drawn all day
Nothing to do, nothing to say

Was everything a man could want to do

How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend a this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow, no one said a word about the sorrow

Crying off my face again
The silent sound of loneliness
Wants to follow me to bed
I'm the ghost of a girl
That I want to be most
I'm the shell of a girl
That I used to know well
Dancing slowly in an empty room
Can the lonely take the place of you
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again
Too afraid, to go inside
For the pain of one more loveless night
Or the loneliness will stay with me
And hold me till I fall asleep

That I want to be most
I'm the shell of a girl
That I used to know well

Can the lonely take the place of you
I sing myself a quiet lullaby
Let you go and let the lonely in
To take my heart again
Broken pieces of
A barely breathing story
Where there once was love
Now there's only me

"He called her on the road
From a lonely cold hotel room
Just to hear her say I love you one more time
But when he heard the sound
Of the kids laughing in the background
He had to wipe away a tear from his eye
A little voice came on the phone
Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind",Happy
"She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright

Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes",Happy

There's only one place they call me one of their own
Just a hometown boy born a rolling stone

There's only one place left I want to go
Who says you can't go home?

"I went as far as I could
I tried to find a new face
There isn't one of these lines that I would erase
I lived a million miles of memories on that road
With every step I take, I know that I'm not alone
You take the home from the boy
But not the boy from his home
These are my streets, the only life I've ever known
Who says you can't go home?",Happy
"I been there, done that, and I ain't looking back
It's been a long, long road
Feels like I never left, that's how the story goes

Take it in, take it with you when you go

You can't miss it it's the first thing that you see
Just up the road a pale blue water tower

Yea this is my town

I would tell you how much that I've missed you

For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
By hurting you",Happy
"My child arrived just the other day
He came to the world in the usual way
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay
He learned to walk while I was away
And he was talking 'fore I knew it, and as he grew
He'd say ""I'm gonna be like you, dad""
""You know I'm gonna be like you""
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
Little boy blue and the man in the moon
""When you coming home, dad?"" ""I don't know when""
But we'll get together then
You know we'll have a good time then",Happy
"My son turned ten just the other day
He said, thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw, I said-a, not today
I got a lot to do, he said, that's okay
And he, he walked away, but his smile never dimmed
It said, I'm gonna be like him, yeah
You know I'm gonna be like him

"There's two things I know for sure:
She was sent here from heaven and she's daddy's little girl.
As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
And I thank god for all of the joy in my life
Oh, but most of all
For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair

But if you don't mind I'm only gonna kiss you on the cheek this time.""
Oh with all that I've done wrong I must have done something right
To deserve her love every morning and butterfly kisses at night.
All the precious time
Like the wind, the years go by.
Precious butterfly.

She'll make a promise and I'll give her away.
Standing in the bride-room just staring at her.",Happy
"She asked me what I'm thinking and I said
""I'm not sure-I just feel like I'm losing my baby girl.""
She leaned over
Gave me butterfly kisses with her mama there
Sticking little white flowers all up in her hair
""Walk me down the aisle, Daddy-it's just about time.""
""Does my wedding gown look pretty, Daddy? Daddy, don't cry""
Oh, with all that I've done wrong I must have done something right.

And I bet you didn't know under that live oak

From ""Better Homes and Garden"" magazine
Plans were drawn and concrete poured
And nail by nail and board by board

Bank let's me borrow from month to month
Running out of credit and find a little cash on the radio

Dump this truck and the little I've got
On a loan to own and a 3 acre lot

She's never rocked Central Park to a half a million fans screaming out her name
She's never hit a shot to win the game
She's never left her footprints on the moon
She's never made a solo hot air balloon ride around the world
No she's just your everyday average girl (but)

But now her baby's movin' on and she'll soon be missin' her
But not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face
She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress

Feeds her mama with a spoon

And at times you'll think she hates him
Then he'll walk her down the isle
And he'll raise her veil
But right now she up and crying
And the truth is that he don't mind
As he kisses her good night
And she says her prayers
He lays down there beside her
Till her eyes are finally closed
And just watching her it breaks his heart
Cause he already knows
It wont be like this for long

All grown up and gone
Yeah this phase is gonna fly by

"I hope you never lose your sense of wonder,
You get your fill to eat but always keep that hunger,
May you never take one single breath for granted,
God forbid love ever leave you empty handed,
I hope you still feel small when you stand beside the ocean,
Whenever one door closes I hope one more opens,
Promise me that you'll give faith a fighting chance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance...
I hope you never fear those mountains in the distance,
Never settle for the path of least resistance,",Happy

Lovin' might be a mistake, but it's worth makin',

Give the heavens above more than just a passing glance,
And when you get the choice to sit it out or dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.
I hope you dance... I hope you dance.

"When I became a father in the spring of '81
There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end
I took my daddy's secret and passed it on to him
I said
Let me tell you a secret about a father's love
A secret that my daddy said was just between us

And the most beautiful girl holding both of them

Well, now that I'm a father,
I'm scared to death one day my daughter
Is gonna find
That teenage boy I used to be,
Who seems to have just one thing on his mind.

She's growing up so fast. It won't be long
Before I'll have to put the fear of God
Into some kid at the door.

Yeah, we think she's something else.

Where my daddy took my mom so many times
And we found the time to mention things we never had before
And we shared some thoughts about the family life.

And he'd sit in the shade and watch the chickens peck

He said he was a cowboy when he was young
He could handle a rope and he was good with a gun
And my mama's daddy was his oldest son,

I am the product of his sacrifice
I am the accumulation of the dreams of generations

I am my father's daughter

"I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should
His fingerprints are everywhere
I just look down to stop and stare
Open my eyes and then I swear
I saw God today",Happy
"Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But notice she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red
I've been to church
I've read the book
I know He's here
But I don't look
Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should",Happy
"He built me a house in the arms of a tree
He taught me to drive and to fight and to dream
When he looks in my eyes I hope he can see that
My dad's a hero to me
Rust ridden fenders
And doors full of dings
Somehow he can fix about anything
I didn't think he knew how to cry
'Til our dog died that year
He doesn't always say I love you
But I can hear him loud and clear",Happy
"He likes to pelt carolers with icy snowballs
I'd like to take him out back and deck more than the halls
With family like this, I would have to confess
I'd be better off lonely, distraught, and depressed
The season's upon us, it's that time of year
Brandy and eggnog, there's plenty of cheer
There's lights on the trees and there's wreaths to be hung
There's mischief and mayhem and songs to be sung
They call this Christmas where I'm from
My mom likes to cook, push our buttons, and prod
My brother just brought home another big broad
The eyes rollin' whispers come love from the kitchen
I'd come home more often if they'd only quit bitchin'",Happy
"Dad on the other hand's a selfish old sod
Drinks whiskey alone with my miserable dog
Who won't run off fetch sure he couldn't care less
He defiled my teddy bear and left me the mess
The season's upon us, it's that time of year
Brandy and eggnog, there's plenty of cheer
There's lights on the trees and there's wreaths to be hung
There's mischief and mayhem and songs to be sung
They call this Christmas where I'm from
The table's set, we raise a toast, the father, son, and the Holy Ghost
I'm so glad this day only comes once a year
You can keep your opinions, your presents, your happy new year
They call this Christmas where I'm from
They call this Christmas where I'm from",Happy
"Mom got drunk and dad got drunk
At our Christmas party
We were drinkin' champagne punch
And homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him
'Til he sang Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad
Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife, Lynn
And the two identical twins
From his second wife, Mary Nell
Of course he brought his new wife Kaye
Who talks all about AA
Chain smokin' while the stereo plays
Noel, Noel, the first Noel",Happy
"Carve the turkey, turn the ball game on
Mix margaritas when the eggnog's gone
Send somebody to the Quick-Pak store
We need some ice and an extension cord
A can of bean dip and some Diet-Rite
A box of Pampers, some Marlboro Lights
Hallelujah, everybody say ""cheese""
Merry Christmas from the family
Fran and Rita drove from Harlingen
I can't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motorhome in
They blew our Christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited on our front lawn
He threw the breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night
Oh silent night, oh holy night",Happy
"Ramblers in the wilderness
We can't find what we need
We get a little restless from the searching
Get a little worn down in between
Like a bull chasing the matador
Is the man left to his own schemes
Everybody needs someone beside 'em
Shining like a lighthouse from the sea
Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When you're low
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night winds are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home",Happy
"Face down in the desert now
There's a cage locked around my heart
I found a way to drop the keys where my failures were
Now my hands can't reach that far
I ain't made for a rivalry
I could never take the world alone
I know that in my weakness I am strong
But it's your love that brings me home
Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When you're low

"And when you call
And need me near
Sayin' where'd you go?
Brother, I'm right here
And on those days
When the sky begins to fall
You're the blood of my blood
We can get through it all
Brother, let me be your shelter
Never leave you all alone
I can be the one you call
When you're feelin' low
Brother, let me be your fortress
When the night winds are driving on
Be the one to light the way
Bring you home",Happy
"But if I saw me through your eyes
Maybe I could find a way
To forgive all of the lies
And the stupid things I say
And if I could realize
That it's your blood that I bleed
Maybe I could love myself
Like the way that you love me
If I saw me through your eyes
Your eyes
Through your eyes
Through my mother's eyes",Happy
"When we were young we were the ones
The kings and queens oh yeah, we ruled the world
We smoked cigarettes man no regrets
Wish I could relive every single word
We've taken different paths
And travelled different roads
I know we'll always end up on the same one when we're old
And when you're in the trenches
And you're under fire I will cover you",Happy
"If I was dying on my knees
You would be the one to rescue me
And if you were drowned at sea
I'd give you my lungs so you could breathe
I've got you brother-er-er-er

I've got you brother-er-er-er
I've got you brother-er-er-er

Beneath the skin of our tattoos
Though we don't share the same blood
You're my brother and I love you that's the truth",Happy
"I wish Sunday's on a creek bank would never end
Wish I could learn to drive again
Wish the first time, seventeen
She was my everything
Kiss in a Chevrolet could happen every day
I wish everybody overseas was gonna make it home
I wish Country music still got played on Country radio
And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died
Never died",Happy
"So are we still trying?
Or simply surviving?
We're facing these giants
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
But I still believe in
They dreams we've been dreaming
The hope that we build on
It's never too far, it's never too far
If we choose to turn and let these walls fall down
Are we too far apart?
Two worlds among the stars
You're gonna take a piece of my heart
If you leave",Happy
"So it's two separate ways
Or am I too late to say?
I wanna fight for what we got
'Cause I believe in family.
In family
In family
I still believe
I still believe that we're not too far apart
Two worlds among the stars
Don't take a piece of my heart
Please, don't leave
It's not too late to say
Father, show us the way
To fight for what we got 'cause you believe in family

"They say dads are supposed to shape you, in a way I guess mine did
I knew what I wouldn't do if I ever had a kid
They say history repeats itself
Well, I guess that's up to me
Yeah, I grew up without a dad
I'm gonna be the best one I can be
Someone to let you fall down and teach you how to get back up
And teach you how to be sweet like mama and how to be tough

Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength

What you got in the box only Gracie knows
And I would never try to make you be

You gotta do what I say",Happy
"Now the pot of coffee's almost gone, as we turn another page
We're climbing on him like a Jungle Jim, watching his hair turn gray
All the Polaroids are just reminders,
You can't hold life in a three ring binder
We flipped on through 'em anyway
There's a picture at his sister taken in July
On the steps of the church pulling out his tie
Hair's still wet from gettin' baptized, the brand new blue suit on
An old set of keys to his Chevrolet
A crumpled up receipt for a wedding ring
We watched ourselves grow up there in his arms
In the book of John",Happy
"That sun came up, we were wide awake
Head to toe in black and gray
Long black Lincoln waiting down the drive
He was father, son, husband and friend
I still flip through it every now and then
When I need just a few words of advice
It's almost like he's not really gone
And I know one day I'll be passin' on
The book of John",Happy
"He was a giant
And I was just a kid
I was always trying
To do everything he did
I can still remember every lesson he taught me
Growing up learning how to be
Like my old man
He was a lion
We were our father's pride
But I was defiant
When he made me walk the line
He knew how to lift me up
And when to let me fall
Looking back, he always had a plan
My old man",Happy
"My old man
Feel the callous on his hands
And dusty overalls
My old man
Now I finally understand
I have a lot to learn
From my old man
Now I'm a giant
Got a son of my own
He's always trying
To go everywhere I go
Do the best I can to raise him up the right way
Hoping that he someday wants to be
Like his old man",Happy

The most meanest MC on this on this Earth

Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way
Into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak

Trying to find the mystery clue
Hitting me with the third degree
Working on a thumbscrew

Everything's coming back
I didn't mean to hurt that woman of mine
It was a heart attack

You came to rain a flood

"I turn the music up
I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight
Maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beatin' to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance
All the kids all night
Until Monday mornin' feels another life
I turn the music up
I'm on a roll this time
And heaven is in sight
I turn the music up

Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black
Maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart
As we saw, woah, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams

The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh no

So slow we're almost standing still
Her warm breath against my neck

Or is she the one who's having fun drinking too much beer

'Cause deep inside he knows you'll be returning
And he's got something you can't live without

Get me out of this cave!
As fear and shock register, he assures himself that self-control will provide some security,
But this thought is abandoned as the stalactites and stalagmites lock into a fixed position, Forming a cage whose bars are moving in towards him.
If I keep my self-control,
I'll be safe in my soul.
And the childhood belief
Brings a moment's relief,
But my cynic soon returns
And the lifeboat burns.
My spirit just never learns.
Stalactites, stalagmites
Shut me in, lock me tight.
Lips are dry, throat is dry.
Feel like burning, stomach churning,
I'm dressed up in a white costume
Padding out leftover room.
Body stretching, feel the wrenching
In the cage
Get me out of the cage!
At one moment there is a flash of light and he sees an infinite network of cages all strung together by a rope like material.
In the glare of a light,
I see a strange kind of sight;
Of cages joined to form a star
Each person can't go very far;
All tied to their things
They're netted by their strings,
Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings.
As the rocky bars press in on Rael's body, he sees his brother John outside, looking in.

He turns his head so slowly round.
I cry out Help! before he can be gone,
And he looks at me without a sound.
And I shout out 'John please help me!'
But he does not even want to try to speak.
I'm helpless in my violent rage
And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek,
And I watch him turn away and leave the cage.
My little runaway.
(Raindrops keep failing on my head, they keep falling on my...)
In a trap, feel a strap
Holding still. Pinned for kill.
Chances narrow that I'll make it,
In the cushioned straight-jacket.

They got me by my neck and feet.
Pressures building, can't take more.

Reminds me of childhood memories

She takes me away to that special place
And if I stare too long, I'd probably break down and cry

Sweet child o' mine
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies

To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill

But empty pop bottles was all we would kill.

Who were making plans and thinking of the future

With their hearts they turned to each other's hearts for refuge

Some of them knew pleasure
And some of them knew pain
And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered
And on the brave and crazy wings of youth
They went flying around in the rain
And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered

And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow
For the glitter and the rouge

By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power
And they struggled to protect her from them
Only to be confused
By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour

In the naked dawn only a few survived
And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge
Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge

On the road, on the road that we're going
We all need, we all need words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother
Love him that's the only way
I was a woman never thinking of others
And my life was so lonely, didn't care for anybody
But then I happened to meet a begging man in the street
As I turned down his praying I heard someone saying
Treat him well, he is your brother, brother
You might need his help one day, he's your brother
We depend on one another, brother
Love him that's the only way
On the road, on the road that we're going, that we're going
We all need, we all need words of comfort and compassion
Treat him well, he is your brother, brother

"So at last you're free
It's the way you wanted it to be
And the price you paid
To become a woman of today
Is it worth the pain to see the children cry
Does it hurt when they ask for Daddy
Hey hey Helen
Now you live on your own
Hey hey Helen
Can you make it alone
(Yes you can)
So you're free at last
And beginning to forget the past
Does it make you Sad
When you think about the life you ha-ha-had
But you're right, you had to take a second chance
So you fight to find your freedom

"You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst
(And when you're feeling so bad)
And you think you're cursed

Well, if there's one thing for the better that can turn you loose

Jerry works at the office, Sue lies by the pool
But on all weekends

When I meet my friends
(I'm gonna see them now)
And we're lookin' round for the action we sure play it cool

It's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul
There's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

You paint your world and use all colours
Ah-haa (ah-haa)
And then you find it all comes out too bright
You know it's only a lie
Ah-haa (ah-haa, ah-haa)
The songs you sing are too romantic
Ah-haa (ah-haa)
And when you want the truth
They only spit in your eye
Oh yeah, they're only telling you lies
Oh yeah, there's gotta be rock'n roll
To fill the hole in your soul

You feel bad, let me tell you, we all get the blues
Sometimes life is a burden, weighed down in your shoes
When it's bad, worse, worst

And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to the wonderful adventures
The places I had planned for us to go

And why, I just don't know

Walking in the moonlight, love-making in the park

In the sun, I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong
I know what's waiting there for me
Tonight I'm loose and fancy-free, ah-ah
When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
Lots to take and lots to give

Some folks only see the litter
We don't miss them when they're gone

I just know it's time to go

From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning

Like a melody can?

Who can live without it, I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance what are we?
So I say thank you for the music
For giving it to me
So I say
Thank you for the music, for giving it to me",Relax
"Must have left my house at eight, because I always do
My train, I'm certain, left the station just when it was due
I must have read the morning paper going into town
And having gotten through the editorial, no doubt I must have frowned
I must have made my desk around a quarter after nine
With letters to be read, and heaps of papers waiting to be signed
I must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so
The usual place, the usual bunch
And still on top of this I'm pretty sure it must have rained
The day before you came
I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
And at the time I never even noticed I was blue
I must have kept on dragging through the business of the day
Without really knowing anything, I hid a part of me away
At five I must have left, there's no exception to the rule
A matter of routine, I've done it ever since I finished school
The train back home again
Undoubtedly I must have read the evening paper then
Oh yes, I'm sure my life was well within it's usual frame
The day before you came
Must have opened my front door at eight o'clock or so
And stopped along the way to buy some Chinese food to go
I'm sure I had my dinner watching something on TV
There's not, I think, a single episode of Dallas that I didn't see
I must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten
I need a lot of sleep, and so I like to be in bed by then
I must have read a while
The latest one by Marilyn French or something in that style
It's funny, but I had no sense of living without aim
The day before you came
And turning out the light
I must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night
And rattling on the roof I must have heard the sound of rain
The day before you came",Sad
"I believe your new girl turned you down
And they say she's pushing you around
How does it feel? I guess it hurts your pride
Tell me my friend, how many nights you cried
Disaster and disgrace
The king has lost his crown
Suddenly
He's clumsy like a clown
The world is upside down
The king has lost his crown
Was it hard to step down from your throne
And to know tonight you're all alone?
Oh what a shame, you really want that girl
She doesn't care, still you just dream of her

We're following the piper

From the west and the north and from the east

He seduced everybody in the land

Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill
Birds of passage, you and me
We fly instinctively
When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks
Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex
We're still striving for the sky
No taste for humble pie
Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun
Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done
It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor
How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more
Clear-headed and open-eyed
With nothing left untried
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done
Standing calmly at the crossroads, no desire to run
There's no hurry any more when all is said and done",Sad

Only the names have been changed
To protect the guilty

And I headed for the smoke
Got a rock n roll band and a fast right hand
Gonna get to the top
Nothings gonna stop us, no nothing

When they used to be new
When they used to be clean

While I'm in the band doing drinking with the boys
She's working 9 to 5
She knows her place, that woman

In my rock 'n' Rolls Royce with the sun roof down
My bottle of booze
No summer time blues

"In the beginning
Back in 1955
Man didn't know 'bout a rock 'n' roll show
And all that jive
The white man had the schmaltz
The black man had the blues
No one knew what they was gonna do
But Tschaikovsky had the news, he said
Let there be sound, and there was sound
Let there be light, and there was light
Let there be drums, there was drums
Let there be guitar, there was guitar
Oh, let there be rock!
And it came to pass
That rock 'n' roll was born
All across the land every rockin' band
Was blowin' up a storm
And the guitar man got famous
The business man got rich
And in every bar there was a superstar
With a seven year itch
There was fifteen million fingers
Learnin' how to play
And you could hear the fingers pickin'
And this is what they had to say
Let there be light, sound, drums, guitar
Oh, let there be rock!
One night in a club called the Shakin' Hand
There was a 42 decibel rockin' band
And the music was good and the music was loud
And the singer turned and he said to the crowd:
""Let there be rock""",Energetic

I took a shot on the chin
I'm rearranging my game
Tell by the shape I'm in
In line of fire, you know what to say

We walked in darkness, kept hittin' the walls
I took the time, to feel for the door
I found the secret, the key to it all
I got the Nouveauree
And dragged it home to bed
I traded you for me
I took it all and said
I find my own fun,
Sometimes for free
I got to pay it to come lookin' for me
Walkin' on Gucci
Wearin' Yves Saint Laurent
Barely stay on 'cause I'm so God damn gaunt

Believe me when I tell you
Nobody ever dies in their dreams
I think I need a stay of execution
In a wink, I'm dead in love again
Nine Lives - Puss & booty
Nine Lives - Live again
Nine Lives - It ain't over
Nine Lives - Live for ten
Well well well
Engine room to bombardier
Is this a dreamI died and went to Heaven
She's enough to make you
Cry in your beer
How can a good thing
7 come 11
Slip into a fare thee well
And how can one man's
Little bit o' Heaven
Turn into another man's Hell
I think I need a stay of execution
Yeah I know, I'm dead in love again
Nine Lives - Hello lucky
Nine Lives - Live again

"I sailed an ocean, unsettled ocean
Through restful waters and deep commotion
Often frightened, unenlightened
Sail on, sail on sailor
I wrest the waters, fight Neptune's waters
Sail through the sorrows of life's marauders
Unrepenting, often empty
Sail on, sail on sailor
Caught like a sewer rat alone but I sail
Bought like a crust of bread, but oh do I wail
Seldom stumble, never crumble
Try to tumble, life's a rumble
Feel the stinging I've been given
Never ending, unrelenting
Heartbreak searing, always fearing
Never caring, persevering
Sail on, sail on, sailor
I work the seaways, the gale-swept seaways
Past shipwrecked daughters of wicked waters
Uninspired, drenched and tired
Wail on, wail on, sailor
Always needing, even bleeding
Never feeding all my feelings
Damn the thunder, must I blunder
There's no wonder all I'm under
Stop the crying and the lying
And the sighing and my dying",Sad
"I've been in this town so long that back in the city
I've been taken for a lost and gone
An unknown for a long long time
Fell in love years ago
With an innocent girl
From the Spanish and Indian home
Home of the heroes and villains
Once at night Catillion squared the fight
And she was right in the rain of the bullets that eventually brought her down
But she's still dancing in the night
Unafraid of what a dude'll do in a town full of heroes and villains
In the cantina
Margarita's keep the spirit high
There I watched her
She spun around and
Round in the warmth of her body
Fanned the flame of the dance
Dance Margarita don't you know that I'm in love with you
Dance

You're under arrest
My children were raised
You know they suddenly rise
They started slow long ago
Head to toe healthy wealthy and often wise
At three score and five

"Now here's a little story I've got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Adrock, MCA and me, Mike D
I had a little horse named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer
Riding across the land, kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is gettin' hot the beer is getting flat
Lookin' for a girl I ran into a guy
His name is MCA, I said, ""Howdy"" he said, ""Hi""",Sad
"He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, and he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?""
I said, you can't get none
Had a chance to run
He pulled out his shotgun
Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said
""Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill
Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer
I run this land, you understand, I've made myself clear""
We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over but it's ready to begin",Energetic
"""Now I got the gun, you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me""
I said, I'll ride with you if can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter
I did it like this, I did it like that
I did it with a wiffleball bat
So I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Adrock that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne""
We rode for six hours then we hit the spot
The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said ""Y-y-yo, you know this kid?""
I said, I didn't, but I know he did
The kid said ""Get ready 'cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D and I'm about to get money""
Pulled out the jammy, aimed it at the sky
He yelled ""Stick 'em up"" and let two fly
Hands went up and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
""I'm Mike D and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect""
MCA was with it and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face
The piano player's out, the music stopped
His boy had beef and he got dropped

Confused and wondering of how I came to die, to die...

For if I was dead, how and why did I die?
But I composed myself
And decided I should face him
But I stood paralyzed on the supposed golden path

His words flowed like glowing lava from the mouth of a volcano

And whatever differences our lives have been
We together make a limb""

Made a seam to hem me in
There at the fair when our eyes caught, careless
Got my heart right pierced by a pin
But oh, did you see all the dead of Manassas
All the bellies and the bones and the bile
No, I lingered here with the blankets barren
And my own belly big with child
But when the sun breaks
To no more bullets in Battle Creek
Then will you make a grave
For I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
I will be home then
Stems and bones and stone walls too
Could keep me from you

To keep me from you

Though our skin may not touch skin
Look for me with the sun-bright sparrow

Our shoes were our show boats
We kicked around
From stairway to station
We made a sensation
With the gadabout crowd

We're two easy targets
For the old men at the off-tracks
Who've paid in palaver
And crumpled old dollars

Your cool was contagious
At the old school
You left without leaving
A note for your grieving
Sweet mother, while
Your brother was so cruel
And here in the alleys

In bathrooms and barrooms
On dumpsters and heirlooms

I ran away to Charlottesville
And worked in a sawmill or two

Why did they tear it down
And why did I leave the plow in the field
And look for a job in the town
 Well my girl she ran off with somebody else
The taverns took all my pay
And here I stand where the old home stood
Before they took it away

Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air

Seeking a place to stand or a place to hide
Down in the crowded bars out for a good time,
Can't wait to tell you all what it's like up there

Any heart not tough nor strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain
Love hurts

I'm young, I know, but even so
I know a thing or two
I've learned from you
I've really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a stove, burns you when it's hot
Love hurts
Love hurts
Some fools rave of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
But they're not fooling me
I know it isn't true, know it isn't true
Love is just a lie, made to make you blue

Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember

A sight came before my eyes
It was a little hippie boy
I must have been twice his size
His appearance typefied his strange breed
Gaudy clothes, long stringy hair hanging down
I'd seen perhaps a thousand
In my early trips to town
As he walked on beside me on down the block
I noticed no unpleasing smell
He might have been on the weed or even LSD
But if he was I couldn't tell
So we walked together that way through this neighborhood

He said ""friend you know we're a million miles apart

With a bottle of wine
And some pills off the shelf

And I'm feeling so ashamed

It's because there's something very special about it
Either that or it's because everybody else sings about it, always has

Still sitting there,
Wonder if they're late for church
And it's cold, so they fasten their coats
And cross the grass, they're always last.

Ahead they see a small girl
On her way home with a pram.
Inside the archway,
The priest greets them with a courteous nod.

Ducked into a bar door

We can discover the wonders of Nature
Rolling in the rushes down by the riverside

She's got everything I need
Takes the wheel when I'm seeing double
Pays my ticket when I speed
She come skimming through rays of violet
She can wade in a drop of dew

Jump like a Willys in four wheel drive

You look the picture of contented new wealth
But from the on-looking fool who believed your lies

When the wheel of fortune broke, you fell to me
Out of grey skies to change my misery
The vacant spot, your beating heart took its place
But now I watch smoke leave my lips and fill an empty room

The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill
The bitterest pill is mine to take
If I took if for a hundred years, I couldn't feel anymore ill

Twisted and broken dawn, no days with sunlight
The dying spark, you left your mark on me
The promise of your kiss, but with someone else

You've achieved your aim by making the walking lame
And when you just can't get any higher
You use your senses to suss out this week's climber
And the small fame that you've acquired
Has brought you into cult status
But to me you're still a collector
There's tarts and whores but you're much more
You're a different kind 'cause you want their minds
And you just don't care 'cause you've got no pride

Filing down her nails with a emory board
Talking to her friends about people they knew
And all of the things that young girls do
When she said, ""You see that guy in the baseball cap?
I'd like to spend some time with a boy like that
Betty said, ""I've seen him at the hardware store""
I think his name is Billy, but I'm not sure
And as they talked a little while he passed by
She smiled at him he just said ""Hi.""

Can I take you out on a Saturday night?

On a little old house at the edge of town
And that night as he held her he couldn't believe
That God had made a girl that he'd never ever leave

Strange how hard it rains now
Rows and rows of big dark clouds
When I'm holding on underneath this shroud
Rain, oh rain
Strange how hard it rains now
Rows and rows of big dark clouds
When I'm holding on underneath this shroud

"It's been four weeks since the treatment
And my mind is still a mess
And what's left to be remembered
Well, it's anybody's guess
'Cause my past is like the weather
It will come and it will go
I don't know, even know
What it is that I don't know
I'm some Christopher Columbus
Sailing out into my mind
With no map of where I'm going
Or of what I've left behind

I don't know, the things I don't know
I'm sure something's missing, I wish it would show
I don't know, you say take it slow
And I do, although, how I do, I don't know",Sad

Are the dreams all made solid
Are the dreams made real
All of the buildings, all of the cars
Were once just a dream
In somebody's head
She pictures the broken glass, pictures the steam
She pictures a soul
With no leak at the seam
Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness
Let's take the boat out
Wait until darkness comes
Nowhere in the corridors of pale green and gray
Nowhere in the suburbs
In the cold light of day
There in the midst of it, so alive and alone
Words support like bone

Where you're inside out

In your daddy's arms again

Tugging at the darkness, word upon word
Confessing all the secret things in the warm velvet box
To the priest, he's the doctor
He can handle the shocks
Dreaming of the tenderness
The tremble in the hips
Of kissing Mary's lips
Dreaming of Mercy Street
Where you're inside out
Dreaming of mercy
In your daddy's arms again
Dreaming of Mercy Street
Swear they moved that sign
Looking for mercy
In your daddy's arms
Mercy, Mercy, looking for Mercy Street...
Looking for Mercy, Mercy...
Looking for Mercy, Mercy, looking for Mercy...
Looking for Mercy, looking for Mercy...

"I remember when I was a little girl, our house caught on fire
I'll never forget the look on my father's face as he gathered me up
In his arms and raced through the
Burning building out on the pavement
And I stood there shivering in my pajamas
And watched the whole world go up in flames
And when it was all over I said to myself
Is that all there is to a fire?
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
And when I was twelve years old
My daddy took me to the circus, the greatest show on Earth
There were clowns and elephants and dancing bears
And a beautiful lady in pink tights flew high above our heads
And as I sat there watching
I had the feeling that something was missing
I don't know what, but when it was over I said to myself
Is that all there is to the circus?
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is my friends, then let's keep dancing
Let's break out the booze and have a ball
If that's all there is
And then I fell in love
With the most wonderful boy in the world
We'd take long walks by the river or
Just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes
We were so very much in love
Then one day he went away and I thought I'd die, but I didn't
And when I didn't I said to myself
Is that all there is to love?
Is that all there is, is that all there is?
If that's all there is, my friends, then let's keep
I know what you must be saying to yourselves
If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all?
Oh, no, not me, I'm not ready for that final disappointment
Because I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you
That when that final moment comes and I'm
Breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself
Is that all there is, is that all there is?

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way
I've looked at clouds from both sides now
From up and down, and still somehow
It's cloud illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way

You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care, don't let them know

They shake their heads, they say I've changed

I make all these plans with friends and hope they call and cancel
Then I overthink about the things I'm missing
Now I'm wishing I was with 'em

Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine

Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

It's laughter and it's loving I disdain
I am a rock I am an island
Don't talk of love
Well I've heard the word before
It's sleeping in my memory
I won't disturb the slumber of feelings that have died
If I never loved I never would have cried
I am a rock I am an island
I have my books
And my poetry to protect me
I am shielded in my armor
Hiding in my room safe within my womb
I touch no one and no one touches me
I am a rock I am an island
And a rock feels no pain
And an island never cries",Sad
"She put him out like the burnin' end of a midnight cigarette
She broke his heart, he spent his whole life tryin' to forget
We watched him drink his pain away a little at a time
But he never could get drunk enough to get her off his mind
Until the night
He put that bottle to his head and pulled the trigger
And finally drank away her memory
Life is short, but this time it was bigger
Than the strength he had to get up off his knees
We found him with his face down in the pillow
With a note that said, ""I'll love her till I die""
And when we buried him beneath the willow
The angels sang a whiskey lullaby
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

This dirty road is taking me
Sometimes I can't even see the reason why
I guess I keep a-gamblin'
Lots of booze and lots of ramblin'
It's easier than just waitin' around to die
One time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa
He beat her with a belt once 'cause she cried
She told him to take care of me
Headed down to Tennessee
It's easier than just waitin' around to die
I came of age and I found a girl
In a Tuscaloosa bar
She cleaned me out and hit in on the sly
I tried to kill the pain, bought some wine
And hopped a train
Seemed easier than just waitin' around to die
A friend said he knew
Where some easy money was
We robbed a man, and brother did we fly
The posse caught up with me
And drug me back to Muskogee
It's two long years I've been waitin' around to die
Now I'm out of prison
I got me a friend at last

His name's Codine
He's the nicest thing I've seen

I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'
I'll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
And the executioner's face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I'll tell and speak it and think it and breathe it
And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it
And I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'
But I'll know my song well before I start singin'
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall ",Nature

"Back when I was a child
Before life removed all the innocence
My father would lift me high
And dance with my mother and me and then
Spin me around till I fell asleep
Then up the stairs he would carry me
And I knew for sure I was loved",Happy
"When I and my mother would disagree
To get my way I would run from her to him
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah
Then finally make me do just what my momma said
Later that night when I was asleep
He left a dollar under my sheet
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me",Happy

I walk her down the aisle.
It's a shame her Mom can't be here now,

"The greatest man I never knew
Lived just down the hall
And every day we said, ""Hello""
But never touched at all
He was in his paper
I was in my room
How was I to know he thought I hung the moon?
The greatest man I never knew
Came home late every night
He never had too much to say
Too much was on his mind
I never really knew him
Oh, and now it seems so sad
Everything he gave to us, took all he had",Happy

And the memories to black and white
He grew cold like an old winter wind
Blowing across my life

But there was business left to do
He never said he loved me

Waiting for my prince to come
Praying for the healing rain

"I spent twenty years trying to get out of this place
I was looking for something I couldn't replace
I was running away from the only thing I've ever known
Like a blind dog without a bone
I was a gypsy lost in the twilight zone
I hijacked a rainbow and crashed into a pot of gold
I been there, done that

Saving dimes, spending too much time on the telephone

She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes

It always winds up feeling more like a job interview

Who wouldn't find out about me and then turn around and run

The porch lights on, come on in if you wanna

For twenty years there at home
Until the day her girl was grown
Giving all her love to her was her life's ambition
But now her baby's movin' on and she'll soon be missin' her
But not today
Those are tears of joy runnin' down her face
She's somebody's hero
A hero to her daughter in her wedding dress
She gave her wings to leave the nest
It hurts to let her baby go down the aisle
She walks right by
Looks back into her mother's eyes
And that smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero",Happy

Her daughter's starin' at all the photographs
Of her mother
And she wishes she could be like that

She runs a brush through her silver hair
The envy of the nursing home
She drops by every afternoon
Feeds her mama with a spoon
And that smile lets her know
Her mother's smile lets her know
She's somebody's hero",Happy

Of my daddy's name

Hank, why do you drink?
Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?

I go wonderin' once again
Back to the seasons of my youth
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us
And how my momma put the rags to use
There were rags of many colors
Every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat
And it was way down in the fall
Momma sewed the rags together
Sewin' every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors
That I was so proud of",Happy

That my momma made for me
Made only from rags
But I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money
I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors
My momma made for me",Happy
"And oh, I couldn't understand it
For I felt I was rich
And I told 'em of the love
My momma sewed in every stitch
And I told 'em all the story
Momma told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors
Was worth more than all their clothes",Happy
"But they didn't understand it
And I tried to make them see

Well, now that I'm a father,
I'm scared to death one day my daughter
Is gonna find
That teenage boy I used to be,
Who seems to have just one thing on his mind.

She's growing up so fast. It won't be long
Before I'll have to put the fear of God
Into some kid at the door.

And tell me 'bout yourself.
So, you like my daughter, do you now?
Yeah, we think she's something else.

Probably be up all night

"And now looking back I can recall the times we disagreed
When I could not take gold of his old fashioned ways
And the more I tried to prove him wrong the more I proved him right
Now I know why he still stood by me when I went through that stage.

I'm seein' my father in me, I guess that's how it's meant to be
And I find I'm more and more like him each day
I notice I walk the way he walks I notice I talk the way he talks
I'm starin' to see my father in me.

And I'm happy to see my father in me..",Happy

Dishes in the sink to do

There's bedtime prayers to pray
""Sleep tights"" and ""I love you's""

Knowing that he couldn't have the toy

I bowed my head and I prayed real hard
Said lord please help me help my stupid self

Turning on my son's scooby doo nightlight

He closed his little eyes, folded his little hands
And spoke to God like he was talking to a friend

"Everytime, I see a woman on a billboard sign
...I think about you
Saying, ""Drink this beer... & you'll be mine""
...I think about you
When an actress, on the movie screen
Plays lolita, in some old man's dream
It doesn't matter, who she is
...I think about you
When, I see a pretty woman, walkin' down the street
...I think about you
Men look her up & down, like she's some kind of treat
Oh... I think about you",Happy
"She wouldn't dare, talk to a stranger
Always has to be aware, of the danger
Doesn't matter, who she is
I think about you...
Eight years old
Big, blue eyes
And a heart of gold
When, I look at this world
I think about you...
And I can't help but see
That every woman, used to be
Somebody's little girl
...I think about you",Happy
"Look at the two of you dancin' that way
Lost in the moment and each other's face
So much in love, you're alone in this place
Like there's nobody else in the world
I was enough for her not long ago
I was her number one, she told me so
And she still means the world to me, just so you know
So be careful when you hold my girl
Time changes everything, life must go on
And I'm not gonna stand in your way
But I loved her first, I held her first
And a place in my heart will always be hers
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me",Happy
"I knew the love of a father runs deep
And I prayed that she'd find you someday
But it's still hard to give her away
I loved her first
From the first breath she breathed
When she first smiled at me
I knew the love of a father runs deep
Someday you might know what I'm goin' through
When a miracle smiles up at you
I loved her first",Happy
"Driving through town just my boy and me
With a happy meal in his booster seat
Knowing that he couldn't have the toy
'Till his nuggets were gone
Green traffic light turned straight to red
I hit my brakes and mumbled under my breath
His fries went a flying and his orange drink covered his lap
Well then my four year old said a four letter word
That started with ""s"" and I was concerned
So I said son now now where did you learn to talk like that",Happy
"He said I've been watching you dad, ain't that cool
I'm your buckaroo, I wanna be like you
And eat all my food and grow as tall as you are
We like fixing things and holding mama's hand
Yeah we're just alike, hey ain't we dad
I wanna do everything you do
So I've been watching you
With tears in my eyes I wrapped him in a hug
Said my little bear is growing up
And he said but when I'm big I'll still know what to do",Happy
"Life throws you in
To the unknown
And you feel like you're
Out there all alone
These are words
That every girl should have a chance to hear
There will be love
There will be pain
There will be hope
There will be fear
And through it all year after year
Stand or fall I will be right here
For you",Happy
"Well, I just heard the news today
It seems my life is going to change
I closed my eyes, begin to pray
Then tears of joy stream down my face
With arms wide open under the sunlight
Welcome to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open
With arms wide open
Well, I don't know if I'm ready
To be the man I have to be
I'll take a breath, I'll take her by my side
We stand in awe, we've created life",Happy

Welcome to this place, I'll show you everything
With arms wide open, now everything has changed
I'll show you love, I'll show you everything

If I had just one wish, only one demand
I hope he's not like me, I hope he understands",Happy

"Still the same old neighborhood like many years ago
Houses sit in white picket frames like Rockwells in a row
I've always been a rebel son but daddy didn't mind
He wanted me to chase my dreams the way he did one time
Now he's on the front porch as I get out of my car
And as my father's eyes meet mine there's one wish in my heart
I'm wishin' my daddy was forty again
He would be young and I would be ten
We would go fishin' throw an old ball around
Wash his truck go into town
We can never go back to the way it was then
Just for today I wish he was forty again",Happy
"Now we'll sit and talk for hour of life out on the road
What I've seen and where I've been and journeys left to go
Mama looks at both of us ""you're like two kids I swear""
Then the stories turn to laughter before the leaving turns to tears
I'm wishing my daddy was forty again
Hw would be young and I would be ten
We would go fishin' throw an old ball around
Wash his old truck go into town
We could never go back to the way it was then
Just for today I wish he was forty again
Oh, and just for today I wish he was forty again",Happy
"You're gonna make the finest momma someday
Some man will take you away
But until then
Chase down your dreams
Laugh all the time and believe
That love's gonna conquer all things
So until then
I'll be your man
There was a time when I thought I knew love
Until you came into this world
Time keeps on flying
But your always gonna be my baby girl",Happy
"So as you walk through this life you will see
The world's what you want it to be
But until then
Go on and dance
Dance like there's no one around
Never stop singing out loud

There was a time when I thought I knew love
Until you came into this world
Time keeps on flying
But your always gonna be my baby girl",Happy

"I'll always love my mama
She's my favorite girl
I'll always love my mama
She brought me in this world
Sometimes I feel so bad
When I think of all the things I used to do
How mama used to clean somebody elses house
Just to buy me a new pair of shoes
I never understood how mama made it through the week
When she never ever got a good night's sleep",Happy

I just keep comin' back to see
If I can capture the dream
Yeah love, you done all you can do to me
I don't give up so easily
No, you ain't seen the last of me
I got a big, long list
Of all the times I've missed
When I zeroed in on love
And at times it seems
Like one heartache begins
Where the last one has just left off ",Happy
"I close my eyes and she's right there
Barbie dolls and teddy bears
Picking buttercups from the yard
Putting them in mason jars
Tea parties and pecan pie
Make me think of her every time
Yes sir, yes maam
It wouldn't be who I am

If it wasn't for a woman
Leading me by the hand
Helping me understand
If it wasn't for a woman
Teaching me wrong from right
Praying for me at night
I'd be half the woman I am
If it wasn't for a woman
",Happy
"
I met a man that treats me good
Opens my door like a gentleman should
She always said ""Don't settle for less,
No girl deserves second best""
Sometimes when I miss her
I can still hear her sweet words
""I love you, be safe""
I wouldn't be here today

If it wasn't for a woman
Leading me by the hand
Helping me understand
If it wasn't for a woman
Teaching me wrong from right
Praying for me at night
I'd be half the woman I am

"He got here and wrinkled scared and cryin'
The she took him up and held him to her breast
And he sure was glad to get what mama offered
Then he went to sleep and put his fears to rest
It didn't seem to matter what he needed
He could always count on mama to supply
And regardless of the sleep she might be losin'
He always found a twinkle in her eye
There ought to be a hall of fame for mamas
Creation's most unique and precious pearls",Happy
"Let her hear me cry
I couldn't bring myself to write it
'Til this darkened day arrived
A song about old promises
Made so long ago
Created and cremated
Ashes of the words I spoke
Long separated by the miles
Distanced from her golden smiles
Memory of a mother
Shared my dreams and really cared
Long separated by the miles
Distanced from her golden smiles
Mama,
I know I wasn't there...",Happy

Never let me bleed
Helped me in my grief
Helped me in my need
Never let me down

"She stepped off of the boat to see flowers in his hands
The man she would marry was as hard as the mountains
She had his children in a log cabin
Soon I'd be another star in this family's constellation
In the land of the midnight sun
Searching for gold
I am my father's daughter
He has his mother's eyes
I am the product of her sacrifice
I am the accumulation of the dreams of generations
And their stories live in me like holy water
I am my father's daughter",Happy
"My father raised me in an old log cabin
And he sang for me the songs his mother sang to him
In honky-tonks, and empty bars, just me and him

Searching for gold",Happy

I've read the book

Open my eyes and then I swear
I saw God today",Happy
"Saw a couple walking by
They were holding hands
And she had that glow
Yeah, I couldn't help
But notice she was starting to show
Stood there for a minute
Taking in the sky
Lost in that sunset
A splash of amber melting into shades of red

I've read the book

Near as often as I should
Yeah, I know I should",Happy
"The season's upon us, it's that time of year
Brandy and eggnog, there's plenty of cheer
There's lights on the trees and there's wreaths to be hung
There's mischief and mayhem and songs to be sung
There's bells and there's holly, the kids are gung-ho
True love finds a kiss beneath fresh mistletoe
Some families are messed up while others are fine
If you think yours is crazy, well, you should see mine
My sisters are wackjobs, I wish I had none
Their husbands are losers and so are their sons
My nephew's a horrible wise little twit
He once gave me a nice gift-wrapped box full of shit",Happy
"Dad on the other hand's a selfish old sod
Drinks whiskey alone with my miserable dog
Who won't run off fetch sure he couldn't care less
He defiled my teddy bear and left me the mess

Brandy and eggnog, there's plenty of cheer
There's lights on the trees and there's wreaths to be hung
There's mischief and mayhem and songs to be sung

The table's set, we raise a toast, the father, son, and the Holy Ghost

At our Christmas party
We were drinkin' champagne punch
And homemade eggnog
Little sister brought her new boyfriend
He was a Mexican
We didn't know what to think of him
'Til he sang Feliz Navidad
Feliz Navidad
Brother Ken brought his kids with him
The three from his first wife, Lynn
And the two identical twins
From his second wife, Mary Nell
Of course he brought his new wife Kaye
Who talks all about AA
Chain smokin' while the stereo plays
Noel, Noel, the first Noel",Happy
"Carve the turkey, turn the ball game on
Mix margaritas when the eggnog's gone
Send somebody to the Quick-Pak store
We need some ice and an extension cord
A can of bean dip and some Diet-Rite
A box of Pampers, some Marlboro Lights
Hallelujah, everybody say ""cheese""
Merry Christmas from the family
Fran and Rita drove from Harlingen
I can't remember how I'm kin to them
But when they tried to plug their motorhome in
They blew our Christmas lights
Cousin David knew just what went wrong
So we all waited on our front lawn
He threw the breaker and the lights came on
And we sang Silent Night
Oh silent night, oh holy night",Happy

Mix Bloody Marys 'cause we all want one
Send somebody to the Stop 'n' Go

Hallelujah, everybody say ""cheese""

"Ramblers in the wilderness
We can't find what we need
We get a little restless from the searching
Get a little worn down in between
Like a bull chasing the matador
Is the man left to his own schemes
Everybody needs someone beside 'em
Shining like a lighthouse from the sea

There's a cage locked around my heart
I found a way to drop the keys where my failures were

But it's your love that brings me home

"I can't believe you love me after all the things I've done
I think I've been the devil since the day that I turned one
Like when I stole your money just to buy a pack of gum
I know it wasn't funny, can't believe I was so dumb
I blame it on my age but even now I'm not so young
I'm still stuck in my ways I can't believe what I've become

And when you're in the trenches
And you're under fire I will cover you",Happy

Broken pieces lying around where it went down
Water rising back to silence, quietly crying
Wondering how and look at us now
We thought our love would take the world by storm
Are we too far apart?
Two worlds among the stars

I wanna fight for what we got

For everything I just couldn't do
And I've hurt myself
By hurting you",Energetic
"Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity
Don't check on me
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you",Energetic
"I have a very good friend
The kind of girl who likes to follow a trend
She has a personal style
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
You hear her voice everywhere
Taking the chair
She's a leading lady
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day
She's a girl with a taste for the world
(The world is like a playing ground where she goes rushing)
Head over heels
Setting the pace
Running the gauntlet in a whirl of lace
She's extreme, if you know what I mean
Her man is one I admire
He's so courageous but he's constantly tired
Each time when he speaks his mind
She pats his head and says, ""That's all very fine""
""Exert that will of your own
When you're alone
Now we'd better hurry""
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
Head over heels
Breaking her way
Pushing through unknown jungles every day

"You're asleep on the couch with Tammy
And she looks straight up at me
The reproach in her eyes is imagined
But the pain that I feel is real
She jumps down and her tail is swishing
Like a feather right under your nose
And then you wake up and you're bleary-eyed
I say I'm sorry, I can see you've cried
You look frail as you stand before me
Then you curse and kick a chair
And the dog, bless her heart, licks my fingers
But she jerks every time you swear
I feel sick and my hands are shaking
This is how all our fights have begun
You say you've had it
And you say, ""screw you""
I say, ""I love you""
And I know it's true
You're not the man you should have been
I let you down somehow (not the one I could have been)
I'm not the woman I could have been (I can be that woman)
But I can be that woman now
You're confused when you turn to face me
Is it true or is she drunk?
But it's clear that I've hit my rock bottom
I'm aware of how far I've sunk
And the dog is the first to feel it
There's a shimmer of Energetic in your eyes
You can't believe it
But you're close to tears
Oh God, I'm sorry for the wasted years

"I'm hearing images, I'm seeing songs
No poet has ever painted
Voices call out to me, straight to my heart
So strange yet we're so well acquainted
I let the music speak, with no restraints
I let my feelings take over
Carry my soul away into the world
Where beauty meets the darkness of the day
Where my mind is like an open window
Where the high and healing winds blow
From my shallow sleep the sounds awake me
I let them take me
(Let them wake me, let them now, let them take me)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Some streets are emptiness, dry leaves of autumn
Rustling down an old alley
And in the dead of night I find myself
A blind man in some ancient valley
I let the music speak, leading me gently
Urging me like a lover
Leading me all the way
Into a place
Where beauty will defeat the darkest day
Where I'm one with every grand illusion
No disturbance, no intrusion
Where I let the wistful sounds seduce me
I let them use me
(All illusion, no disturbance, no intrusion)
Let it be a joke
Let it be a smile
Let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be a tear
Let it be a sigh
Coming from a heart, speaking to a heart, let it be a cry
Let it be the joy of each new sunrise
Or the moment when a day dies
I surrender without reservation
No explanations
No questions why
I take it to me and let it flow through me
Yes, I let the music speak
I let the music speak",Relax

To talk about impending doom?

He said, I'm a minister

He was giving me the eye
So I took advantage
Of the fact that I'm a star
Shook my hair and took
A casual stroll up to the bar
And as sure as hell
This guy was coming up to me
He said, who am I and
Who are you and who are we
What's our situation do
We have some time for us?

Out of nine lives, I spent seven
Now, how in the world do you get to Heaven
Oh, you don't know the shape I'm in

I just spent 60 days in the jailhouse
For the crime of having no dough
Now here I am back out on the street
For the crime of having nowhere to go

An' midnights broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing

Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
An' for each an' every underdog soldier in the night

Even though a cloud's white curtain
In a far-off corner flashed
An' the hypnotic splattered mist Was slowly lifting

Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing",Relax

He only wants to observe it
We sit back like they taught us
We keep quiet like they taught us

Get me out of this cave!
As fear and shock register, he assures himself that self-control will provide some security,
But this thought is abandoned as the stalactites and stalagmites lock into a fixed position, Forming a cage whose bars are moving in towards him.
If I keep my self-control,
I'll be safe in my soul.
And the childhood belief
Brings a moment's relief,
But my cynic soon returns
And the lifeboat burns.
My spirit just never learns.
Stalactites, stalagmites
Shut me in, lock me tight.
Lips are dry, throat is dry.
Feel like burning, stomach churning,
I'm dressed up in a white costume
Padding out leftover room.
Body stretching, feel the wrenching
In the cage
Get me out of the cage!
At one moment there is a flash of light and he sees an infinite network of cages all strung together by a rope like material.
In the glare of a light,
I see a strange kind of sight;
Of cages joined to form a star
Each person can't go very far;
All tied to their things
They're netted by their strings,
Free to flutter in memories of their wasted wings.
As the rocky bars press in on Rael's body, he sees his brother John outside, looking in.
John's face is motionless despite screams for help,
But in his vacant expression a tear of blood forms and trickles down his cheek.
Then he calmly walks away leaving Rael to face the pains which are beginning to sweep through his body. ",Relax
"Outside the cage I see my Brother John,
He turns his head so slowly round.
I cry out Help! before he can be gone,
And he looks at me without a sound.
And I shout out 'John please help me!'
But he does not even want to try to speak.
I'm helpless in my violent rage
And a silent tear of blood dribbles down his cheek,
And I watch him turn away and leave the cage.
My little runaway.
(Raindrops keep failing on my head, they keep falling on my...)
In a trap, feel a strap
Holding still. Pinned for kill.
Chances narrow that I'll make it,
In the cushioned straight-jacket.
Just like 22nd Street,
They got me by my neck and feet.
Pressures building, can't take more.
My headaches charge, earaches roar.

Get me out of this pain.
If I could change to liquid,
I could fill the cracks up in the rocks.

The ghost of Anne Bolyn walks, they declare
Poor Anne Bolyn was once King Henry's wife
Until he made the headsman bob her hair
Ah, yes, he did her wrong long years ago
And she comes up at night to tell him so
With her head tucked underneath her arm
She walks the bloody tower
With her head tucked underneath her arm
At the midnight hour

Gadzooks, she's going to tell him off, she's feeling very sore
And just in case the headsman wants to give her an encore
She has her head tucked underneath her arm",Relax

They think that it's Red Grange instead of poor old Ann Bolyn
With her head tucked underneath her arm.
Sometimes gay King Henry gives a spread
For all his pals and gals and ghostly crew
The headsman craves the joint and cuts the bread
Then in comes Anne Bolyn to queer the do
She holds her head up with a wild war whoop
And Henry cries ""don't drop it in the soup!""",Relax

Up my spine and growing strong

We don't miss them when they're gone

My kind of people everywhere, ah-ah

I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning

It's a dream, it's out of reach

"There is unrest in the forest
Trouble with the trees
For the maples want more sunlight
And the oaks ignore their pleas
The trouble with the maples
(And they're quite convinced they're right)
They say the oaks are just too lofty

Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need
Is this the world we created?
What did we do it for?
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law?
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today?
The world that we created
You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by
Oh, oh, oh, Is this the world we created?
We made it on our own
Is this the world we devastated
Right to the bone?
If there's a God up in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created?",Nature
"Let the music keep our spirits high
Let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky
Some of them were angry
At the way the earth was abused
By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power
And they struggled to protect her from them
Only to be confused
By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour
And when the sand was gone and the time arrived
In the naked dawn only a few survived
And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge
Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge
Let the music keep our spirits high
Let the buildings keep our children dry
Let creation reveal it's secrets by and by, by and by
When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky",Nature

I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard

And what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall
